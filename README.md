##### 2.3.2 Run single test file
Cypress provides the Test Runner that allows you to run testing files separately and see 
the execution process:  https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Overview

In the Test Runner you will see the list of testing files. You may click any of them and execution 
tests within a single it would be started in a separate window. Pay attention that results recording 
is not performed if you use the Test Runner. So, this option is mostly for 
development and issues investigation. For running all the scope you should better use other options.
